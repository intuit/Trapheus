<p id="description"><b>Introducing TrapheusAI:</b> Next gen automated data analysis co-pilot. <br/> <br/>
Traditional search engines have always relied on keyword search much like the indexes you find in the back of books. 
Unless a query matches a keyword in your index, the search engine can come up with fuzzy or no answers. TraphesuAI aims to solve
this problem shifting from "matching" to "understanding". Driven by AI , it represents the unstructured search space 
conceptually which can be interprested by machines. 

Powered by niche graph and search technology it overcomes the limitations of traditional keyword based models and it helps
you orient, discover and navigate.
