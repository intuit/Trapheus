Open source projects are "living". Contributions in the form of issues and pull requests are welcomed and encouraged. When you contribute, you explicitly say you are part of the community and abide by its Code of Conduct.

# The Code

At Intuit, we foster a kind, respectful, harassment-free cooperative community. Our open source community works to:

- Be kind and respectful;
- Act as a global community;
- Conduct ourselves professionally.

# The conduct

- Follow Through - Do whatever you say and consistently deliver on the commitment.
- Proactively Communicate - When something takes longer that we envisioned and why
- Improved communication  - In order for others to listen we need to hone the way we deliver the message
- Volunteer Information - Make a genuine effort to help people understand ambigous ideas and concepts. Share the decisions and diversions. Letting others know before they figfure out on their own shows ownerships and prevents misunderstandings
- Be forthright and authentic - Be authentic with your feelings , even when you hold contradictory opinions communicate with respect and tact.
- Be objective and neutral - When in tough situations act as a diplomat resolving conflicts instead of causing them.
- Consistency in behaviour - Follow throigh and eliminate any double standards that may exist
- Trust people - Give others benefit of doubt and build strong mutual relationship

As members of this community, we will not tolerate behaviors including, but not limited to:

- Violent threats or language;
- Discriminatory or derogatory jokes or language;
- Public or private harassment of any kind;
- Other conduct considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
