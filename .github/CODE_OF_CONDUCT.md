# The Code

At Intuit, we foster a kind, respectful, harassment-free cooperative community. Our open source community works to:

- Be kind and respectful;
- Act as a global community;
- Conduct ourselves professionally.

# The conduct

- Follow Through - Do whatever you say and consistently deliver on the commitment.
- Proactively Communicate - When something takes longer that we envisioned and why
- Improved communication  - In order for others to listen we need to hone the way we deliver the message
- Volunteer Information - Make a genuine effort to help people understand ambigous ideas and concepts. Share the decisions and diversions. Letting others know before they figfure out on their own shows ownerships and prevents misunderstandings
- Be forthright and authentic - Be authentic with your feelings , even when you hold contradictory opinions communicate with respect and tact.
- Be objective and neutral - When in tough situations act as a diplomat resolving conflicts instead of causing them.
- Consistency in behaviour - Follow throigh and eliminate any double standards that may exist
- Trust people - Give others benefit of doubt and build strong mutual relationship

As members of this community, we will not tolerate behaviors including, but not limited to:

- Violent threats or language;
- Discriminatory or derogatory jokes or language;
- Public or private harassment of any kind;
- Other conduct considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
